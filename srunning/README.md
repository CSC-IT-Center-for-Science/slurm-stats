## srunning

srunning shows currently running jobs in the selected partitions (by default
all accelerator partitions), and the most time-consuming binary being run by
the user on the node.


### Usage
```
./srunning 

```

One can use the -p flag to set partition (as in squeue).

```
./srunning  -p parallel
```
